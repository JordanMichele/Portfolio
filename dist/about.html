        <p class="indented"> My name is Jordan, I'm 25 years old and have a deep passion for web development. My
          enthusiasm for web development includes, all things front-end including (HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, JavaScript,
          Sass, React.js … and so much more!). I graduated from SUNY Oswego with a bachelor’s degree in marketing. 
          While attending college I played collegiate lacrosse and also happened to be a contracted cadet in the Army ROTC Program. 
          I've now served over 5 years for the US Army obtaining life skills such as problem solving, teamwork, communication and responsibility. </p>
